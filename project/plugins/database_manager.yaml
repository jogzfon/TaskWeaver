  - It connects to a MySQL database named 'biblio_system'. Ensure the database is accessible and the connection details are correct.
  - The plugin includes safety checks to prevent execution of queries involving sensitive information or non-read-only operations.
  - Results are returned as a string, which can be further processed or converted to other formats as needed.
  - Error messages and query details are printed to the console for debugging purposes.
